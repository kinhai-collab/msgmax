## 🚀 What It Does

MsgMax is a Chrome extension that integrates directly into Gmail to analyze your messages in real-time. It catches:

- 🚩 **Passive-aggressive language** ("Per my last email...")
- 😰 **Desperation signals** (Excessive apologies, over-eagerness)
- 😤 **Anger/frustration** (ALL CAPS, sarcasm)
- 🎭 **Tone mismatches** (Too casual for boss, too formal for friends)
- 🤝 **Overpromising** ("I'll definitely...", "I guarantee...")
- 🎯 **Vagueness** (Unclear asks, no action items)

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **Real-time Gmail integration** - Button appears right next to Send
- ✅ **AI-powered analysis** - Uses Claude AI for smart detection
- ✅ **Risk scoring** - Get a 1-10 score for every message
- ✅ **Suggested rewrites** - Not just warnings, actual fixes
- ✅ **Context-aware** - Understands recipient type (boss vs. friend)
- ✅ **Privacy-focused** - Analysis only happens when you click
